# 🌍 Brazilian Diaspora

## 📖 About the Project
This project was inspired by the [Workout Wednesday 2025 – Week 4](https://workout-wednesday.com/) challenge, which featured a rotatable globe visualization built with **Deneb** by Ying Fu.  
Their original work explored Chinese migration abroad, and I adapted it to tell a story that is personal to me: the **Brazilian diaspora**. To do that, I used the original data provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and modified the Deneb Vega code to display Brazilian migration data.

As a Brazilian migrant living in Portugal, I was curious to explore how my experience connects with the broader movement of Brazilians around the world. Using the globe visualization, I wanted to show where Brazilians are living abroad and how widespread this diaspora has become.
