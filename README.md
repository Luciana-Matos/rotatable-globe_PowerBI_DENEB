## Brazilian Diaspora – Power BI Rotatable Globe 🌍  

This project was inspired by the [Workout Wednesday 2025 – Week 4](https://workout-wednesday.com/pbi-2025-w04/) challenge, which featured a rotatable globe visualization built with **Deneb** by Ying Fu. Their original work explored Chinese migration abroad, and I adapted it to tell a story that is personal to me: the **Brazilian diaspora**.

## 📖 About the Project  
As a Brazilian migrant living in Portugal, I was curious to explore how my experience connects with the broader movement of Brazilians around the world. Using the globe visualization, I wanted to show where Brazilians are living abroad and how widespread this diaspora has become.
